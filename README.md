# Identifying_sexist_twitter_dataset
This dataset is collected as part of my graduate degree(Ph.D.). These data points were collected from Twitter and got labeled using CrowdFlower in 2019. Each of the tweets was labeled by 6 labelers. In the CSV file, besides the tweets and their labels, you would also see other information related to labelers. <br /> This dataset is **only** for **research purposes** and is protected under license.
