# Identifying_sexist_twitter_dataset
This dataset is collected as part of my graduate degree(PhD). These datapoints come from Twitter and got labaled using CrowdFlower in 2019. Each tweets were labaled by 6 labalers. <br /> In the csv file, beside the tweets and their labales, you would also see other information related to labalers. This dataset is **only** for research purpose.
